/** 
 * The list of all downloads in progress.  DownloadManager has a fixed number 
 * of download slots given by the MAX_SIM_DOWNLOADS property.  It is
 * responsible for starting downloads and scheduling and queueing them as 
 * needed.  This class is thread safe.<p>
 *
 * As with other classes in this package, a DownloadManager instance may not be
 * used until initialize(..) is called.  The arguments to this are not passed
 * in to the constructor in case there are circular dependencies.<p>
 *
 * DownloadManager provides ways to serialize download state to disk.  Reads 
 * are initiated by RouterService, since we have to wait until the GUI is
 * initiated.  Writes are initiated by this, since we need to be notified of
 * completed downloads.  Downloads in the COULDNT_DOWNLOAD state are not 
 * serialized.
